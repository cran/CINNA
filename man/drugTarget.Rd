\description{
A bipartite graph extracted from DrugBank 1.0 database. The network includes two set of nodes
including Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and their corresponding protein targets designated by their Uniprot ID.
The 1080 drugs and their 519 target proteins nodes are connected via 3766 interactions.
Please note that it is a shrunken network in which metabolizing enzymes,
carriers and transporters associated with drug metabolism are filtered and solely
targets directly related to their pharmacological effects are included.
It is also an example of unconnected graphs.
