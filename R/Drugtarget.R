#' @title Drug Target Network
#'
#' @description A bipartite graph extracted from DrugBank 1.0 database. The network includes two set of nodes
#' including Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and their corresponding protein targets designated by their Uniprot ID.
#' The 1080 drugs and their 519 target proteins nodes are connected via 3766 interactions.
#' Please note that it is a shrunken network in which metabolizing enzymes,
#' carriers and transporters associated with drug metabolism are filtered and solely
#' targets directly related to their pharmacological effects are included.
#' It is also an example of unconnected graphs.
